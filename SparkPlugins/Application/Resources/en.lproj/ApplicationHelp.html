 			<p class="answer">An "Application Action" is a simple Spark Action that can launch any Application.<br />
 			You can also use a Document Action to launch an Application,
 			but Application Action have an advantage:
 			if the Application you choose is deplaced on an other Volume (or anything else that normally brakes an Alias),
 			an Application Action will try to find your Application, and not a Document Action.</p>

 		<img src="Help/AppSheet.jp2" alt="" style="margin: 8px 0px 0px 12px; float: right; border: 1px solid #c0c0c0" />
 			<p class="answer">To create a new Application Key, choose "Application" in "New Action" Menu or double clic on the Application List.<br />
 			Then you can choose the Application you want launch with this Action by clicking on the "Choose…" Button.<br />
 			There are 3 possible actions:<br /><br />
 			&nbsp;<strong>• Launch: </strong> Launch an Application or bring it on the foreground if it is already running. In fact Launch has the same effect as double clicking the Application Icon. <br /><br />
 			&nbsp; <strong>• Quit: </strong>Send a Quit signal to the Application. It has the same effect as choose "Quit" in the Application Menu.<br /><br />
 			&nbsp; <strong>• Force Quit: </strong>Use this option with precaution. It has the same effect as choose "Force Quit" in the "Apple Menu".
 			<br clear="all" /><br />
 			When you Launch an Application, you have 4 options:<br />
 			<br />&nbsp;<strong>- "Launch Without Activation"</strong>: The Action doesn't bring the Application to the the foreground.<br />
 			&nbsp;<strong>- "Launch And Hide Others"</strong>: Once the Application is launched, all others Applications are hiden.<br />
 			&nbsp;<strong>- "Launch And Hide"</strong>: Launch the Application and then Hide it.<br />
 			&nbsp;<strong>- "Launch a New Instance"</strong>: If the application is not running, it launchs the Application. If it is already running, instead of bringing it to the foreground, the Action launchs another copy of the Application.
 			This function may not work with all Applications.<br /><br />
