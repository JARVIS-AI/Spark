  <h1>How Does Spark Work ?</h1>
  <p class="indent">Spark contains two applications. The First one, <strong>"Spark"</strong>, is a Hot Keys editor. It allows creating and managed Hot Keys. You can
   launch it by double clicking on Spark Icon. However, if Spark weren't <strong>"Active"</strong> this Hot Key wouldn't work. To activate Spark, you need launch a
   second Application called <strong>"Spark Daemon"</strong>.</p>
  <p class="indent"><strong>"Spark Daemon"</strong> is an invisible background application. It waits for Hot Keys events and when it catches one, executes the action
   you set with <strong>"Spark"</strong>. You can set in Spark's preferences that <strong>"Spark Daemon"</strong> start at launch, i.e. Spark will be activated when
   you login and your Hot Keys will be enabled. You can also launch and stop <strong>"Spark Daemon"</strong> in Spark.</p>
  <div class="taskbox">
   <p>To activate Spark, you can choose menu File > Activate Spark, or click the button <img src="../gfx/start.tif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">
    located in the top of Spark's main window.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>You can check Spark state at bottom of Spark's main window or by looking on the start/stop button icon.</p>
