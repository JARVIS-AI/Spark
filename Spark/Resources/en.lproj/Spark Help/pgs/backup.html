Note that some actions can be broken after an importation. For example, an Action configure to open an   application, will not works if the application is not installed on the target computer.</p>   <p>When you try to import a Library, Spark allows restoring the Library or merges it. If you choose Restore, Spark will destroy all items currently in your Library   and replace them by the full contents of the imported Library.</p>   <p>If you choose to merge, Spark let you choose in a list the items you want to import.</p>  <div class="taskbox">   <p>To export your Library, choose File > Backup Library….</p>   <p></p>   <p></p>   <p>To import a Spark Library File, double clic on it or drag it on the Spark Icon.</p>  </div> </body></html>
